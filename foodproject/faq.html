<h2 id="h2">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<hr>
<div class="">
<h3 class="h3">Why don't you publish every recipes?</h3>
<p class="para">We try to publish recipes that will be of use to the broadest possible audience,
so we refain from publishing recipes that are clearly require restuarant kitchen equipments
of the skills of a professional chef.</p>
<p class="para">The rights to publish the recipes may be limited by the chef or publisher.Because we try to
   keep as many recipes on the site as we can permanently, we may agree to publish a limited
   selection of what appears in a programme. This avoids the need to take down recipes later.</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="h3">Why have you taken down a recipe?</h3>
<p class="para">Chances are it's because the rights have expired. We may also removed recipes where we have a duplicate, or
  where we have doubts about the equality of the recipe. As the site is nearly 20 years old.(that's 90 in internet years),
  there may be some old and less than reliable content.
  </p>

  <hr>

<h3 class="h3">How big are your eggs?</h3>
<p class="para">Eggs are persumed to be medium,unless otherwise specified</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="h3">is the oven temparature given for a fan-assisted or conventional oven?</h3>
<p class="para">Over the years ,the site has switched from publishing recipes with conventional Celsius/Farenheit/Gas Mark .
  If you see a recipe with a Farenheit temperature, then the Celsius oven temperature is for a conventional oven.
  Caveat:Ovens are very different and temperature can vary wildly. You should always bear in mind the nature
  of your own oven, or if you're really, buy an oven thermometer</p>

  <hr>

<h3 class="h3">What's in a teaspoon?</h3>
<p class="para">Measures in teaspoon and tablespoons are using calibrated UK measuring spoons and are assumed to be level - rounded a heaped
will be specified. In the rare mention of dessertspoons,1 dessertspoon=2 teaspoons.</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="h3">How is the cooking time calculated?</h3>
<p class="para">Note that cooking time commences once any cooking of ingresients starts, even if it is not the final cooking time.
However,any recipe that requires overnight preparation,before or after initial cooking,shoul have"overnight"started
as the preparation time</p>

<hr>

<h3 class="h3">Are you recipes tested?</h3>
<p class="para">Recipes that come from TV programmes are usually tested on set by the food stylist. The recipes may also be published
in a book where change can be made and the recipes are tested.(This sometimes account for discrepencies btween the Recipesas
described on the programme and recipes on the website) Recipes that are part of a competitive programme may have been
changed and/or simplified(e.g.,Big Family Cooking Showdown) when they are tested after filmig.</p>
