   Corona COVID-19: Recovered patients have partially reduced lung function
   Chinese researchers have found fluid- or debris-filled sacs in the lungs of 
   those who were infected by COVID-19. Scans suggest sustained organ damage.
    A doctor checks the CT image of the lungs More than 86,000 people worldwide have
    now recovered from the lung disease COVID-19. In those cases, the infection
    manifested itself in mild to moderate form, or it is because these patients
    received excellent medical care.
</p>
<p class="para">
This number can provide solace, on the one hand, but on the other there is still
 little information about how these people are doing after the infection has run its course.

  The majority of virologists are convinced that recovered COVID-19 patients are immune to the
  new SARS-CoV-2 virus after the infection has run its course. After all, the body's own immune
  system has produced precisely those antibodies during the infection that render the pathogen harmless.
</p>
<p class="para">
  This all-clear also applies to those who had only a weak course of the disease
  and showed ofew to no symptoms. Nevertheless, their immune systems reacted to
  the pathogen and produced the corresponding antibodies. A renewed infection with
  the new coronavirus is therefore highly unlikely.
